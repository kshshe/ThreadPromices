and [code](https://github.com/kshshe/ThreadPromises/tree/master/examples/simpleTimeout)


Simple reject on timeout

# Usage

```
new TPromise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Look ma, I am multithread JavaScript!")
})
```

For additional properties put them after executor function (like in setTimeout):

```
new TPromise((resolve, reject, some, additional, properties) => {
    console.log("I have no access to my old lexical environment, but I can use props")
    console.log(some, additional, properties)
}, some, additional, properties)
```
